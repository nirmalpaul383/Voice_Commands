## About Source Project
This application is made with [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and with [Tasker app factory](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory). To install and run the **Voice Commands** (apk format) you will not need any of these applications. However, if you want to <ins>view</ins> , <ins>modify</ins> or <ins>directly run the source project file</ins> you will need Tasker application and if you want to export your own modification then you will need both [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and its extension app [Tasker app factory](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory).

## Installation and Usage
**You can run Voice Commands using two methods:**
1. **Method 1: Android App (apk) Installation:**
    + Download the Voice Commands APK file.
    + Install the APK file on your Android device. (If you encounter issues during installation, use a 3rd-party app installer tool like SAI Split APKs Installer to install the APK file)
    + Launch the Voice Commands app

2. **Method 2: Directly run the project in Tasker:**
    + Install the [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) app from the Google Play Store.
    + Download the Voice Commands project file (Source Project/Voice_Commands.prj.xml)
    + Import the project file into Tasker.
    + Run the **Launcher** task from Tasker.

## Command Developments
You can develop your own commands using JavaScript and using [Tasker's JavaScript interface](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/javascript.html).
To create your own Command, follow these steps:
1. **Write your codes:** Use any code editor to write the JavaScript code for your command.
2. **Copy the code:** Copy the entire JavaScript code from the code editor.
3. **Use VCL Exporter:** Open **VCL_Exporter.html** (Tools/VCL_Exporter.html) in browser (recommended browser is chrome) and paste the copied code.
4. **Export as .vcl file:** Use the tool to wrap the JavaScript code into a Voice Command Loader (.vcl) file.


### Create a new Voice Command Support Library object
To create a new Voice Command Support Library object use **`new VCSL()`** keywords
```javascript
// For Creation ofÂ a new Voice Command Support Library object
const VC_apis = new VCSL();
```


### For getting raw user queries data
For getting raw user queries data use **`userQueries`** property of the `VC_OInfos` global object
```javascript
// For getting user queries (user 's raw command such as "calculate 4585 + 4565") data from the global property VC_OInfos.
let userQueries = VC_OInfos.userQueries;
```


### For getting the matching keyword value from the raw user queries data
For getting the matching keyword value from the raw user queries data use **`matchedKey`** property of the `VC_OInfos` global object
```javascript
// For getting the key value (by which this command is called e.g. "calculate") from the global property VC_OInfos.
let matchedKey = VC_OInfos.matchedKey;
```


### For getting the only expression portion from the userQueries string
For getting the only expression portion from the raw user queries data, <ins>we can subtract matchedKey from the userQueries</ins>
```javascript
// For getting the only expression portion from the userQueries string , we subtract matchedKey from the userQueries
let expression = userQueries.slice(matchedKey.length);
```


### For getting voice input
For getting voice input use **`.getVoice()`** method of the VCSL
```javascript
//For getting the text from speech recognizer and storing it into voice_input variable
let voice_input = VC_apis.getVoice();
```


### For saying some text
For saying some text use **`.say()`** method of the VCSL
```javascript
//Our sample text
let someText = `This is sample text`;

//For saying
VC_apis.say(someText);
```


### To implement the multiple options, use the `.options()` method of the VCSL.
```javascript
const options = ["Hot/Cold","Day/Night","On/Off","Big/Small","Fast/Slow","Left/Right","Up/Down","Yes/No","Red/Green/Blue","Small/Medium/Large","Happy/Sad", "Old/New",
    "High/Low","Easy/Hard","Light/Dark","Simple/Complex","Quiet/Loud","Clean/Dirty","Full/Empty","Open/Closed","True/False","Morning/Afternoon","Summer/Winter","Digital/Analog",
    "Automatic/Manual"]; //Samples randoms options for Voice Command 's Options API preview

VC_apis.say(`Select a random option by saying the corresponding option number`); //For saying the text

let selectedOptn = VC_apis.options(...options); //For interacting with our random options and store the selected option value in to selectedOptn variable

VC_apis.say(`You selected the ${selectedOptn} option`); //For saying the selected option

```
