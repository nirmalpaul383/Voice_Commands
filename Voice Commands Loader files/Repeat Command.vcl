//For Creation ofÂ a new Voice Control Support Library object
let VC_apis = new VCSL();

//For getting user queries (user 's raw command) data from the global property VC_OInfos. (e.g. "repeat this is sample text for repeating")
let userQueries = VC_OInfos.userQueries;

//For getting the key value (by which this command is called) from the global property VC_OInfos. (e.g. "repeat")
let matchedKey = VC_OInfos.matchedKey;

//For getting the only repeating text portion from the userQueries string , we subtract matchedKey from the userQueries.
//(e.g. userQueries: "repeat this is sample text for repeating" , then the repeating text: "this is sample text for repeating")
let repeat_text = userQueries.slice(matchedKey.length);

//For removing whitespace from both sides
repeat_text = repeat_text.trim();

VC_apis.say(`You said: ${repeat_text}`); //For saying the output
